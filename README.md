# PubFind

Pubfind is an application built to answer researcher's questions from a corpus of scientific papers. Answers are formulated from the texts most relevant to the question. By providing citations and original source texts, it enables you to quickly find documents that are relevant to answering your question. 

Pubfind is built on semantic search. Semantic search focuses on understanding the meaning and context of a query and the content being searched, rather than relying solely on keyword matching and statistical analysis. 

It is designed to build a semantic search index over a directory that includes a corpus of scientific papers that you want to study.
